## Key Highlights
- **Problem Solved:** Fixed negative price predictions and handled outliers (capped data at $50k).
- **Model Used:** Multiple Linear Regression.
- **Accuracy:** Achieved an **R² Score of 76.40%**.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the `Boston_House_Price_prediction.ipynb` file.

## Conclusion
